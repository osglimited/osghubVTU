🔴 SUPPORT CHAT SYSTEM — FINAL SPECIFICATION (FIREBASE + chatting STYLE)

We are using Firebase Firestore.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Rebuild the Support system to behave EXACTLY like chat, including real-time messaging, ticket history, and automatic chat reordering when new messages arrive.

VERY IMPORTANT RULE:

Whenever a message is sent or received in a ticket, that specific ticket MUST move to the TOP of the ticket list immediately.

This must work:

On user support page

On admin support page

In real time

Without refresh

Exactly like WhatsApp when a new message arrives.

📁 FIRESTORE DATA STRUCTURE
Collection: tickets

Each document = one support ticket

Fields:

userId

subject

status → open | solved

lastMessage

lastMessageAt

createdAt

deleted (boolean)

⚠️ lastMessage and lastMessageAt MUST be updated on EVERY reply (admin or user).

Sub-collection: tickets/{ticketId}/messages

Each document = one chat message

Fields:

sender → user | admin

text

createdAt

read

🔄 REAL-TIME CHAT FLOW (MANDATORY)

When a message is sent:

Save message to
tickets/{ticketId}/messages

Immediately update parent ticket:

lastMessage

lastMessageAt = serverTimestamp()

Sidebar ticket list must be queried using:

orderBy("lastMessageAt", "desc")


Result:

The replied ticket jumps to the TOP

Old chats move down

Works exactly like WhatsApp

🧑 USER SIDE REQUIREMENTS

User can create multiple tickets

All tickets remain listed (history)

Tickets sorted by latest activity

Clicking a ticket opens its own chat

When admin replies, ticket moves to top

User can:

Send messages

Reopen solved tickets

User cannot delete tickets

🛠 ADMIN SIDE REQUIREMENTS

Admin sees all tickets

Same WhatsApp-style sidebar

Real-time updates

Admin can:

Reply

Mark solved

Reopen

Delete tickets (removes from both sides)

⚡ REAL-TIME RULES

Use Firestore onSnapshot

No polling

No refresh

No mock / dummy / placeholder data

Everything must be live and accurate

❗ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Messages must NEVER mix between tickets

Each ticket is isolated

Deleting a ticket removes it completely

Solved tickets stay readable

Ordering logic must be DATA-DRIVEN, not UI tricks

🔍 FINAL CHECK REQUIREMENT

Before marking complete:

Deep-scan entire support system

Confirm ticket reordering works perfectly

Confirm multi-ticket per user works

Confirm real-time sync is stable

Confirm WhatsApp-style behavior is accurate

✅ END RESULT EXPECTED

A fully functional chatting-style support system where:

Tickets behave like chats

Replies move chats to the top

Admin and users communicate smoothly

Firebase is used correctly
